## 🏝️ Oasis Prototpe
This is a prtotype of an idea for a desktop application that I have had for a while called Oasis. 
This prototype was made to satisfy the requirements for my Student Innovation Project during college.
Oasis allows the user to create their own custom stress relief experience through the use of video, audio, and stress 
relief exercise guides. As of February 13th, 2026 I am currently working on the official version of Oasis that will 
perform the same purpose but with a better UI and better code.
## ✨ Technologies
- C#
- XAML
- WPF (.NET)
- .mp4 (Video)
- .wav (Audio)
## 🚀 Features
- Allows the user to select a stress relief exercise guide.
- Allows the user to preview or select a video.
- Allows the user to preview or select an audio.
- Combines video, audio, and a stress relief guide of the users choosing to create a unique stress relief experience.
## 📌 The Reason
When I started my first student innovation project class in college I brainstormed a couple of ideas for what projects I 
could work on that would fulfill the requirements of being an innovation and show off the skills that I have aquired 
during my time in college. My professor reccomended picking an idea that I would personally be invested in and
something that would stand out and be innovative and thats when I landed on my favorite idea, Oasis. I have always 
struggled dealing with stress and I always wanted to create something that could potentially help myself as well as 
others. I also noticed that not only are there very few stress relief applications on desktop systems but they can also
feel a bit restrictive. Thats when I came up with Oasis, an appliation made for desktop PCs that allows the user to
create their own custom stress relief experience that best suits them.
## 📖 How To Use
Using the Oasis prototype is pretty easy thanks to the tabs at the top. Each tab reveals selectable UI elements for the
user to design their own stress relief experience. The user can either select breathing exercises, seated exercises, or
full body exercises. It should be noted that the user doesn't need to select an exercise guide, video, or audio for 
the application to start their custom stress relief exprience. The stress relief experience can be just audio, video, or 
an exercise guide invididually or their can be a combination of any of those three things. Moving on to the video tab the
user can either select or preview a video with the play button next to each selection button. The preview will play in 
the small rectangle in the top right of the menu and can be paused whenever the user chooses to. Finally there is the audio
tab which allows the user to select which audio file they want played during their custom stress relief experience. Just like
the video tab it allows the user to preview the different audios that are avaible and the user has the ability to pause the
video whenever they choose to. Once the user has made their exercise guide, video, and audio selection they can move on to
the start menu. The start menu allows the user to quickly view the selections that they have made, allows the user to undo
those selections, and start the custom stress relief exprience with the start button. Upon hitting the start button the
custom stress relief exerience will start and when the user wishes to end the experience all they need to do is hit the back
button located at the bottom of the screen.
