## 🏝️ Oasis Prototpe
This is a prtotype of an idea for a desktop application that I have had for a while called Oasis. 
This prototype was made to satisfy the requirements for my Student Innovation Project during college.
Oasis allows the user to create their own custom stress relief experience through the use of video, audio, and stress relief exercise guides.
As of February 13th, 2026 I am currently working on the official version of Oasis that will perform the same purpose but with a better UI and better code.
## ✨ Technologies
- C#
- XAML
- WPF (.NET)
- .mp4 (Video
- .wav (Audio)
## 🚀 Features
- Allows the user to select a stress relief exercise guide.
- Allows the user to preview or select a video.
- Allows the user to preview or select an audio.
- Combines video, audio, and a stress relief guide of the users choosing to create a unique stress relief experience.
## 📌 The Reason
When I started my first student innovation project class in college I brainstormed a couple of ideas for what projects I could
work on that would fulfill the requirements of being an innovation and show off the skills that I have aquired during my time in
college. My professor reccomended picking an idea that I would personally be invested in and something that would stand out and
be innovative and thats when I landed on my favorite idea, Oasis. I have always struggled dealing with stress and I always wanted
to create something that could potentially help myself as well as others. I also noticed that not only are there very few stress
relief applications on desktop systems but they can also feel a bit restrictive. Thats when I came up with Oasis, an appliation
made for desktop PCs that allows the user to create their own custom stress relief experience that best suits them.
